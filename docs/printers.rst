Hewlett-Packard (HP)
====================

The HP drivers are called `HPLIP`. They are open-source and they are installed by default in Linux Mint. As a result, most HP printers and scanners work out of the box and don't require you to install any additional drivers.

If your HP printer or scanner isn't detected or isn't working properly you can try to upgrade your HP drivers to a newer version or you can try driverless printing.

Installing a newer HPLIP version:
---------------------------------

To check which version of HPLIP you have open a terminal and type:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt version hplip
